I hope I uploaded that version of the project

So, I’m saying that I’m not happy with my project and I would have done better 100% but I didn’t fit in a little on my own time, so I’ll probably redo it after you answer
I didn’t do it, I don’t know why, maybe I didn’t have a big wish, or maybe I got caught up in it myself
Well, I want you to redo it after you answer, and I want you to look at it again.
But I liked this interview experience, thank you for that, because here they check how you can get out of a particular situation and here it is purely necessary to use your knowledge :3
